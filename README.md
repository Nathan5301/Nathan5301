Since the beginning of this year I improved as a content writer. Lately I have been doing several projects. As an SEO specialist Identifying strategies to increase the number of visitors for your website is my main target. My function is essential to raise the company's standard, increasing a higher position within relevant search engines, creating more leads and making a profit.
